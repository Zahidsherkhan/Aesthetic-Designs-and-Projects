            How a Daily Routine Changes Your Life<br>
            Your daily routine consists of all of your habits. These actions structure your day and make the difference between operating at peak efficiency and struggling to make it through a poorly-planned day.
            
            You can have energizing, time-saving routines, or you can adopt draining, inefficient routines. The choice is up to you. Don’t feel bad if you know that some unhealthy habits have crept into your day. The important thing is to recognize them so that you can make a change.
            
            An excellent daily routine sets you up for success. If you make just one change that saves you 10 minutes per day, you can regain 60 hours of your precious time back each year.[1]
            
            Best Daily Routines for a Healthy Life
            It takes time to become the best version of yourself, but I’ll help you to make it easier by getting you a few healthy daily routine examples to follow directly.
            
            Daily Routine for Good Health and More Energy
            1. Start the Day With a Glass of Lemon Water
            Simply add the juice of half a lemon to your glass and drink it to enjoy a refreshing start to the day.
            
            Lemon juice reduces your body’s acidity levels, which, in turn, protects you against inflammatory diseases, such as fungal infections and osteoporosis.[2]
            
            2. Exercise in the Morning
            Working out early in the morning improves your energy levels and your circulation, and encourages good lymphatic function. Just 20 or 30 minutes every day can make a difference! Mix up cardio and weights throughout the week for all-over toning and general health.
            
            For great exercises, grab this Cardio Home Workout Plan for free and try the recommended exercises!
            
            Getting on the scale each morning is also an effective way to monitor your weight. Don’t go weeks without weighing yourself, because this allows you to remain in denial about any weight gain.
            
            3. Eat a Good Breakfast
            When you eat breakfast, fuel yourself with a healthy mix of protein, slow-release carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Sensible options include yogurt with nuts and berries, a vegetable omelet, and low-sugar granola bars with a piece of fruit.
            
            4. Stay Hydrated
            Did you know that becoming even slightly dehydrated can lead to lowered mood and decreased concentration? Keep water or other low-sugar drinks on hand to sip throughout the day.[3]
            
            5. Get a Healthy Lunch
            Even the busiest of us can grab a healthy lunch as part of a daily routine. For lunch ideas you can make in advance and take with you to work, check out this post: Healthy Lunch Ideas for Work
            
            Avoid too much fat at lunch time, as it promotes afternoon lethargy, which isn’t going to help you get through a busy day![4]
            
            6. Do Some Mid-Afternoon Stretches
            Most of us have a mid-afternoon “slump” somewhere between 2 and 4 PM, but you can keep yourself going through the day by choosing a healthy lunch and doing some light stretches or a bit of exercise in the afternoon. Check out this list of 29 exercises you can do at (or near) your desk.
            
            7. Dinner
            With a plethora of meal planning apps out there, getting a quick but healthy dinner on the table has never been easier! Be realistic, and choose something that doesn’t require a lot of time or effort to throw together, otherwise you may resort to takeout.
            
            Green vegetables are always a great choice, as they are packed with antioxidants and have an alkanizing effect. Choose plant-based proteins such as tofu or seitan or, if you prefer animal protein, pick fish and lamb rather than beef or chicken to minimize acidity levels in the body.[5]
            
            Avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, because it will prevent you sleeping soundly at night
