            <p style="text-align:center;color:brown ;">So let’s commit to making the time & finding a space where our body and mind are free to relax, breathe & get moving.
                    
                So as we know, the key and daily antidote for a fresh mind & great physical health is,
                
                Exercise. 
                
                All we have to do is figure out how to get started and how to stick to it.
                
                
                “The daily practice of some physical work does not mean to 
                take stress on the body, but it is actually the stress relieving 
                Activity.” - Abou Elmagd, Mohammed *
                
                
                5 Ways to Get Started
                These are the 5 points that we have outlined that will help you get started and motivated to stick to it:
                
                Find out why now & set a goal.
                
                What caused you to want to begin exercising now?
                
                What event occurred that brought this change up right now in your life?
                
                Identifying this will help you in determining the end result that you desire.
                
                When setting your goal, DO NOT SET A S.M.A.R.T. goal. Set a D.U.M.B. Goal. Reference This Blog Post by Brendon Burchard on How to Set a D.U.M.B. Goal.
                
                What active activity do you really enjoy and/or have been interested in beginning?
                
                Exercise doesn’t only have to be weight lifting or running.
                
                Do you enjoy any sports; Tennis, Basketball, Volleyball, Soccer, etc.
                
                What classes have you been interested in signing up for? Yoga, Pilates, Bosu, Cardio?
                
                Start Small: 10 - 15 Minutes a day.
                
                Our purpose here is to start a new routine, the best way to set a new routine in your life is by making small manageable changes consistently.
                
                Starting small will also help you maintain your new routine in the long term.
                
                Find a partner, friend, group.
                
                Somethings seem to be more fun when done with a friend, this is one of them.
                
                This is also a way to keep yourself consistent by becoming accountable to a friend or group.
                
                Who do you want / need to be healthy for?
                
                Another way to keep yourself accountable is to identify who needs you in the best physical and mental shape right now?
                
                Why do they need you in the best physical and mental shape right now? 
                
                There are many ways for you to get started but these are the best to initiate your exercise & fitness journey into a routine.
                
                A routine of exercise that leads to having and keeping a fresh mind & great physical health
