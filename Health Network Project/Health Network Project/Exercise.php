            <p style="text-align:center;color:brown ;">In this article, we explain the different types of exercise and their benefits, as well as the considerations for designing a fitness regime.
    
                Types and benefits
                People divide exercise into three broad categories:
                
                aerobic
                anaerobic
                agility training
                We describe each of these categories below.
                
                Aerobic exercise
                There are several types of exercise, and they provide a range of benefits for health and well-being.
                Aerobic exercise aims to improve how the body uses oxygen. Most aerobic exercise takes place at average levels of intensity over longer periods.
                
                An aerobic exercise session involves warming up, exercising for at least 20 minutes, and then cooling down. Aerobic exercise mostly uses large muscle groups.
                
                Aerobic exercise provides the following benefits:
                
                improves muscle strength in the lungs, heart, and whole body
                lowers blood pressure
                improves circulation and blood flow in the muscles
                increases the red blood cell count to enhance oxygen transportation
                reduces the riskTrusted Source of diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
                improves life expectancyTrusted Source and symptoms for people with coronary artery diseases
                stimulates bone growth and reduces the risk of osteoporosis when at high intensity
                improves sleep hygiene
                enhances stamina by increasing the body’s ability to store energy molecules, such as fats and carbohydrates, within muscle
                Anaerobic exercise
                Anaerobic exercise does not use oxygen for energy. People use this type of exercise to build power, strength, and muscle mass.
                
                These exercises are high-intensity activities that should last no longer than around 2 minutes. Anaerobic exercises include:
                
                weightlifting
                sprinting
                intensive and fast skipping with a rope
                interval training
                isometrics
                any rapid burst of intense activity
                While all exercise benefits the heart and lungs, anaerobic exercise provides fewer benefits for cardiovascular health than aerobic exercise and uses fewer calories. However, it is more effective than aerobic exercise for building muscle and improving strength.
                
                Increasing muscle mass causes the body to burn more fat, even when resting. Muscle is the most efficient tissue for burning fat in the body.
                
                Agility training
                Agility training aims to improve a person’s ability to maintain control while speeding up, slowing down, and changing direction.
                
                In tennis, for example, agility training helps a player maintain control over their court positioning through good recovery after each shot.
                
                People who take part in sports that heavily rely on positioning, coordination, speed, and balance need to engage in agility training regularly.
                
                The following sports are examples of ones that require agility:
                
                tennis
                American football
