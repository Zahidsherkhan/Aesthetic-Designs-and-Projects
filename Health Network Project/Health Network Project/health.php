                <p>The Key to a Fresh Mind and Great Health.
                    We all know we need exercise, but as we all know, 
                    
                    We also struggle to get started.
                    <br>
                    There are so many research studies and paper reviews that state why we should, and must start our fitness journey. Why we should start taking our physical and mental health as serious as we take our jobs. And how incorporating exercise into our daily routines will benefit our health and even extends our lives.
                    
                    The evidence and information is stacked so high yet, we struggle to gain “motivation” or a reason to begin. 
                    
                    “Life is busy”, “I don't have enough time”, “I don't know where to start”, “Its not for me”. 
                    
                    We have all felt the overwhelming way of life due to our day to day duties, but lets not forget that our Mind and Body are the vessel that carry us through and through, time and time again.

    Medicamentos: qué son y para qué sirven
    Sometimes it seems like there are more medicines than there are diseases, and it can be hard to keep them straight. Some can be bought over the counter at pharmacies or other stores. Others require a doctor's prescription. Some are available only in hospitals.
